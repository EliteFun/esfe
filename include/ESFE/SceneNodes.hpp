// Should this be in Graphics folder
// and have a class like this:
/// GameObject<Class c> : public c
/// put GO-specific functions here
// in the graphics folder, there would then
// be a GameObject folder containing classes
// such as RigidBody that would extend this
// new class

// Note: write down ideas for future GO
// childs here:
// - RigidBody
// - Pickup?
// ? Rename to Node/SceneNode?
